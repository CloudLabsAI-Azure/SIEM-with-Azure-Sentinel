# Exercise 2: Conducting log analytics and Threat hunting

### Duration: 30 minutes

## Scenario 

Contoso as a global organization have deployed Azure Sentinel and Microsoft's cloud-native SIEM as a part of their initiative to onboard its cloud resources & server to proactively inverstigate and address the concerns based on potential insider threats and attacks. Thus, Contoso plans on leveraging the services of Microsoft Sentinel for defining a hypothesis, creating a hunt, managing queries, adding bookmarks, interacting with entities, creating incidents, and tracking metrics leading to improved overall security posture.

## Overview

Azure Sentinel leverages Azure Monitor Logs and the Kusto Query Language (KQL) for log analytics. It offers a comprehensive approach to threat detection, incident management, threat hunting, and reporting:

  - **Log Analytics**: Azure Sentinel uses Azure Monitor Logs and KQL for custom queries to analyze log data, uncovering security insights and anomalies.
  - **Threat Detection**: It provides both built-in and custom detection rules, triggering alerts when suspicious events or behaviors are detected, including those informed by threat intelligence.
  - **Incident Management**: Azure Sentinel organizes related alerts into incidents, streamlining the investigation and response process for security analysts.
  - **Threat Hunting**: Security analysts engage in proactive threat hunting by creating custom hunting queries, using workbooks for visualization, and exploring security data to uncover potential threats.

You can find more references about threat detection and hunting in Microsoft Sentinel here: `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/hunting`

In this exercise you will understand & learn how to create, run and analyze the results of the queries based on specific hunts thus unvieling the possible attack points and threat mitigations.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

* [Task 1: Define your hypothesis](#task-1-define-your-hypothesis)
* [Task 2: Create a Hunt](#task-2-create-a-hunt)
* [Task 3: Add a query to the hunt](#task-3-add-a-query-to-the-hunt)
* [Task 4: Add and view the bookmark](#task-4-add-and-view-the-bookmark)
* [Task 5: Interact with entities](#task-5-interact-with-entities)
* [Task 6: Create incidents](#task-6-create-incidents)
* [Task 7: Track metrics](#task-7-track-metrics)

## Task 1: Define your hypothesis

Defining a hypothesis is an open ended, flexible process and can include any idea you want to validate. Common hypotheses include:
 - **Suspicious behavior** - Investigate potentially malicious activity that's visible in your environment to determine if an attack is occurring.
 - **New threat campaign** - Look for types of malicious activity based on newly discovered threat actors, techniques, or vulnerabilities. This might be something you've heard about in a security news article.
 - **Detection gaps** - Increase your detection coverage using the MITRE ATT&CK map to identify gaps.

Microsoft Sentinel gives you flexibility as you zero in on the right set of hunting queries to investigate your hypothesis.

### Task 1.1 : Hypothesis - Suspicious behavior

1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type **Sentinel (1)**, then select **Microsoft Sentinel (2)**.

      ![search sentinel](../media/search_sentinel.png)

2. Select the Microsoft Sentinel Workspace you created earlier. 

      ![select the sentinel workspace](../media/sentinel-workspace.png)

3. Select **Hunting (1)** under **Threat management** section within the left navigation pane of the Microsoft Sentinel page and then click on the **Queries (2)** tab.

      ![search sentinel](../media/hunting_page-queries_tab.png)

4. Click on **Run all queries** and wait for the queries to execute. This process may take a couple of minutes.

      ![Run all queries](../media/run_all_queries.png)

      >**Note**: With a well-established base of queries installed, running all your queries is the recommended method for identifying potentially malicious behaviors.

5. Notice the the **Result count** post the query runs within the metrics bar of the **Microsoft sentinel | Hunting** page. These results of the query runs appear for specific query logs having being identified.

      ![query result count](../media/result-count.png)

6. Click on the **Add filter (1)** button and then select **Results (2)** from the list of options that appear.

      ![filter](../media/filter-results.png)

7. Within the **Results** pop-up dialog box,

    - Select the check boxes having values more than or equal to one **(1)**.
    - Click on **Apply (2)**.
   
    >**Note**: In this way, you can filter out the queries having atleast 1 result for better visibility.
