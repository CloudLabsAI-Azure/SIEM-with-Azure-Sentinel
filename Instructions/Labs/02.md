# Exercise 2: Conducting log analytics and Threat hunting

### Duration: 30 minutes

## Scenario 

Contoso as a global organization have deployed Azure Sentinel and Microsoft's cloud-native SIEM as a part of their initiative to onboard its cloud resources & server to proactively inverstigate and address the concerns based on potential insider threats and attacks. Thus, Contoso plans on leveraging the services of Microsoft Sentinel for defining a hypothesis, creating a hunt, managing queries, adding bookmarks, interacting with entities, creating incidents, and tracking metrics leading to improved overall security posture.

## Overview

Azure Sentinel leverages Azure Monitor Logs and the Kusto Query Language (KQL) for log analytics. It offers a comprehensive approach to threat detection, incident management, threat hunting, and reporting:

  - **Log Analytics**: Azure Sentinel uses Azure Monitor Logs and KQL for custom queries to analyze log data, uncovering security insights and anomalies.
  - **Threat Detection**: It provides both built-in and custom detection rules, triggering alerts when suspicious events or behaviors are detected, including those informed by threat intelligence.
  - **Incident Management**: Azure Sentinel organizes related alerts into incidents, streamlining the investigation and response process for security analysts.
  - **Threat Hunting**: Security analysts engage in proactive threat hunting by creating custom hunting queries, using workbooks for visualization, and exploring security data to uncover potential threats.

You can find more references about threat detection and hunting in Microsoft Sentinel here: `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/hunting`

In this exercise you will understand & learn how to create, run and analyze the results of the queries based on specific hunts thus unvieling the possible attack points and threat mitigations.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

* [Task 1: Enable Azure Sentinel](#task-1-define-your-hypothesis)
* [Task 2: Create a Hunt](#task-2-create-a-hunt)
* [Task 3: Add a query to the hunt](#task-3-add-a-query-to-the-hunt)
* [Task 4: Add and view the bookmark](#task-4-add-and-view-the-bookmark)
* [Task 5: Interact with entities](#task-5-interact-with-entities)
* [Task 6: Create incidents](#task-6-create-incidents)
* [Task 7: Track metrics](#task-7-track-metrics)

## Task 1: Define your hypothesis

Defining a hypothesis is an open ended, flexible process and can include any idea you want to validate. Common hypotheses include:
 - **Suspicious behavior** - Investigate potentially malicious activity that's visible in your environment to determine if an attack is occurring.
 - **New threat campaign** - Look for types of malicious activity based on newly discovered threat actors, techniques, or vulnerabilities. This might be something you've heard about in a security news article.
 - **Detection gaps** - Increase your detection coverage using the MITRE ATT&CK map to identify gaps.

Microsoft Sentinel gives you flexibility as you zero in on the right set of hunting queries to investigate your hypothesis. When you create a hunt, initiate it with preselected hunting queries or add queries as you progress.

### Task 1.1 : Hypothesis - Suspicious behavior

1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type **Sentinel**, then select **Microsoft Sentinel**.

      ![search sentinel](../media/search_sentinel.png)

2. Select the Microsoft Sentinel Workspace you created earlier.

3. Navigate to the Hunting page Queries tab by clicking on **Hunting** (1) under the **Threat management** section within the left navigation pane of the Microsoft Sentinel page and then select the **Queries** (2) tab.

      ![search sentinel](../media/hunting_page-queries_tab.png)

4. Select **Run all queries** and wait for the queries to execute. This process may take time.

      ![Run all queries](../media/run_all_queries.png)

      >**Note**: With a well-established base of queries installed, running all your queries is the recommended method for identifying potentially malicious behaviors.
      >**Note**: Sorting the results by the Results Delta column to understand most recent changes. These results provide initial guidance on the hunt.

### Task 1.2 : Hypothesis - New threat campaign

Content hub offers threat campaign and domain-based solutions to hunt for specific attacks.

1. Install the **Log4J Vulnerability Detection** or the **Apache Tomcat** solutions from content hub.

      ![Run all queries](../media/log4J-apache_tomcat.png)

2. Once installed, you can create a hunt directly from the solution by selecting the installed solution, then the **Actions** button (1) from the right navigation pane that appears and finally clicking on **+ Create hunt (preview)** (2).

      ![create hunt directly](../media/direct_hunt_creation.png)

      >**Note**: If you already have a hunt started, you can select **Add to existing hunt (Preview)** inorder to add queries from the solution to an existing hunt.

3. Alternatively, you can search for queries from these solutions in the Hunting Queries tab. Search by solution name, or filtering by Source Name of the solution.

### Task 1.3 : Hypothesis - Detection gaps

The MITRE ATT&CK map helps you identify specific gaps in your detection coverage. Use predefined hunting queries for specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques as a starting point to develop new detection logic.

1. Navigate to the MITRE ATT&CK (Preview) page by clicking on **MITRE ATT&CK (Preview)** under the **Threat management** section within the left navigation pane of the Microsoft Sentinel page.

2. Unselect items (1) in the Active drop-down menu and select **Hunting queries** in the Simulated filter to see which techniques have hunting queries associated with them.

      ![hypothesis detection gaps](../media/mitre_attack-2.png)

3. Select the card with your desired technique.

4. Select the **View** link next to Hunting queries at the bottom of the details pane. This link takes you to a filtered view of the Queries tab on the Hunting page based on the technique you selected. 

      ![view-technique](../media/view-technique.png)

5. Select all the queries for that technique.

## Task 2: Create a Hunt

There are two primary ways to create a hunt:

1. In the **Queries** tab of the **Microsoft Sentinel | Hunting** page, if you've started with a hypothesis where you've selected certain queries, select the **Hunt actions** drop down menu (1) and click on **+ Create hunt** (2). All the queries you selected are cloned for this new hunt.

      ![create hunt 1](../media/create-hunt.png)

2. If you haven't decided on queries yet, navigate to the **Hunts (Preview)** tab (1) within the **Microsoft Sentinel | Hunting** page and then click on **+ New Hunt** (2) to create a blank hunt.

      ![create hunt 2](../media/create-hunt-2.png)

3. Fill out the hunt name and optional fields. The description is a good place to verbalize your hypothesis. The Hypothesis pull down menu is where you set the status of your working hypothesis. Select **Create** to get started.

      ![create hunt 3](../media/create-hunt-3.png)

### Task 2.1: View Hunt Details

1. Select the **Hunts (Preview)** tab within the **Microsoft Sentinel | Hunting** page to view the newly created hunt. 

   ![view hunt](../media/view-hunt.png)

2. Select the hunt link by name to view the details such as **Hunt name**, **Description**, **Content**, **Last update time**, and **Creation time** inroder to take appropriate actions.

3. Note the tabs for **Queries**, **Bookmarks**, and **Entities** to get more insights.

   ![tab information](../media/tabs.png)

## Task 3: Add a query to the hunt

The **Queries tab** contains hunting queries specific to a hunt. These queries are clones of the originals, independent from all others in the workspace and can be updated or deleted without impacting your overall set of hunting queries or queries in other hunts.

1. Navigate to the **Hunts (Preview)** tab within the **Microsoft Sentinel | Hunting** page and select the newly created hunt link by name which directs to the **Hunt** details page.

2. Click on the **Query actions** dropdown (1) and select the **Add queries to hunt** (2) option. Within the **Add existing queries to hunt** page, select the required queries from the list the and then click on **Add** (3) to adjoin the selected queries to the current hunt. 

    ![Add queries to a current hunt](../media/query-actions.png)

3. Staying on the current **Hunt** page having a list of all the selected queries which were added to the hunt in the previous step, click on **Run all queries** or choose specific queries and select **Run selected queries** inorder to run the queries.

   >**Note**: The **Cancel** button can be used to cancel query execution at any time.

   ![Run all queries/select queries](../media/run_queries.png)

### Task 3.1: Manage queries

1. Staying on the current **Hunt** page having a list of all the selected queries which were added to the hunt in the previous task, right-click a query and select one of the following from the context menu: 

   - Run
   - Edit
   - Clone
   - Delete
   - Create analytics rule
  
   ![Run all queries/select queries](../media/manage-queries.png)

   >**Note**: These options behave just like the existing queries table in the Hunting page, except the actions only apply within this hunt.

2. When you choose to create an analytics rule by selecting the **Create analytics rule** from the list of manage options, the name, description, and KQL query is prepopulated in the new rule creation. A link is created to view the new analytics rule found under Related analytics rules. 

   ![Run all queries/select queries](../media/analytics-rule-from-query-tab.png)

## Task 4: Add and view the bookmark

When you find interesting results or important rows of data, add those results to the hunt by creating a bookmark. For more infromation, refer to [Use hunting bookmarks for data investigations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/bookmarks).

### Task 4.1: Add a bookmark

1. Select a hunt query from the Microsoft Sentinel **Hunt** page and click **View results** in hunting query details pane to view the results in Log Analytics.

   ![view query results](../media/view-results.png)

2. Use the check boxes to select one or more rows that contain the information you find interesting and click **Add bookmark**. This preserves the data in the row for future reference. 

   ![add-bookmark](../media/add-bookmark.png)

### Task 4.2: View bookmarks

1. Navigate to your hunt's **Bookmarks** tab to view your bookmarks with previously created details.

   ![view-bookmark](../media/view-bookmark.png)

2. Select a desired bookmark and perform the following action:
   - Select entity links to view the corresponding UEBA entity page.
   - View raw results, tags, and notes.
   - Select **View source query** to see the source query in Log Analytics.
   - Select **View bookmark logs** to see the bookmark contents in the Log Analytics hunting bookmark table.
   - Select **Investigate** button to view the bookmark and related entities in the investigation graph.
   - Select the **Edit** button to update the tags, MITRE tactics and techniques, and notes.

## Task 5: Interact with entities

1. Navigate to your hunt's **Entities** tab to view, search, and filter the entities contained in your hunt. This list is generated from the list of entities in the bookmarks. The Entities tab automatically resolves duplicated entries.

   ![entities-1](../media/entities-1.png)

2. Select entity names to visit the corresponding UEBA entity page.

3. Right-click on the entity to take actions appropriate to the entity types, such as adding an IP address to TI or running an entity type specific playbook.

   ![entities-2](../media/entities-2.png)

## Task 6: Create incidents

There are two choices for incident creation while hunting.

### Option 1: Use bookmarks

1. Navigate to your hunt's **Bookmarks** tab and select a bookmark or bookmarks.

2. Click on the **Incident actions** button and then select **Create incident** or **Add to existing incident**

   ![create-incident](../media/create-incident.png)

   -  For **Create new incident**, follow the guided steps. The bookmarks tab is prepopulated with your selected bookmarks.
   -  For **Add to existing incident**, select the incident and select the **Accept** button.

### Option 2: Use the Hunts Action 

1. Within the **Hunt** page, select the **Actions** (1) menu and then click on **Create incident** (2).

   ![create-incident-2](../media/create-incident-2.png)

2. During the **Add bookmarks** step, use the **Add bookmark** action to choose bookmarks from the hunt to add to the incident. You're limited to bookmarks that haven't already been assigned to an incident.

3. After the incident is created, it will be linked under the **Related incidents** list for that hunt.

## Task 7: Track metrics

Track tangible results from hunting activity using the metrics bar in the **Hunts** tab. Metrics show the number of validated hypotheses, new incidents created, and new analytic rules created. Use these results to set goals or celebrate milestones of your hunting program.
