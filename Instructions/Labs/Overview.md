# Security Information and Event Management with Microsoft Sentinel

## Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, you'll enable Azure Sentinel, deploy the Microsoft Sentinel Training Lab Solution, and onboard Azure resources. You'll also define a hypothesis for threat hunting, create structured hunts, and use queries to analyze data. This setup enhances your skills in monitoring, detecting, and responding to security threats effectively.



## Objective

* **Deploying Azure Sentinel and Onboarding Cloud Resources and Servers**: This hands-on lab aims to enable Azure Sentinel, deploy the Sentinel Training Lab Solution, and onboard Azure resources. This setup provides advanced security analytics and a training environment, enhancing your ability to monitor, detect, and respond to security threats effectively.

* **Conducting Log Analytics and Threat Hunting**:This hands-on lab guides you to define a hypothesis for threat hunting, create structured hunts in Microsoft Sentinel, and analyze data using queries and bookmarks. Youâ€™ll also learn to create incidents from alerts and track metrics, enhancing your threat detection and investigation skills.

## Pre-requisites

* Familiarity with Azure Portal
* Basic understanding of concepts such as monitoring, logging, and alerting is essential.


## Architecture

This architectural diagram illustrates the process of setting up and utilizing Azure Sentinel, a cloud-native security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. It is divided into two main exercises. The first exercise focuses on onboarding Azure Sentinel, which involves creating a log analytics workspace, initializing Azure Sentinel by linking it to this workspace, and connecting various resources using data connectors. The second exercise is about conducting log analysis and threat hunting. This includes absorbing data into Azure Sentinel, connecting additional resources, and using various tools to analyze the data and hunt for potential security threats. This structured approach ensures effective security management and threat detection within a cloud environment.

## Explanation of Components

**Exercise 1: Azure Sentinel Onboarding**

- **Log Analytics Workspace**: This is the foundational component where all logs and data are collected and stored for analysis.
- **Azure Sentinel Initialization**: This step involves setting up Azure Sentinel by linking it to the previously created log analytics workspace, enabling it to start monitoring and analyzing data.
- **Data Connectors**: These are used to connect various resources (like virtual machines, applications, and other services) to Azure Sentinel, allowing it to ingest data from these sources for security monitoring.

**Exercise 2: Conducting Log Analysis and Threat Hunting**

- **Data Ingestion**:This involves using data connectors to absorb data into Azure Sentinel, ensuring that all relevant information is available for analysis.
- **Resource Connection**: Similar to the onboarding process, this step involves connecting additional resources to Azure Sentinel to expand its monitoring capabilities.
- **Threat Analysis Tools** These tools are used to analyze the ingested data, helping security teams to hunt for and identify potential threats. This includes various analytical tools represented by icons such as graphs and magnifying glasses.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive security management solution, enabling effective monitoring, analysis, and threat detection within a cloud environment
