# Exercise 1: Deploying Azure Sentinel and Onboarding Cloud Resources and Servers

### Duration: 30 minutes

## Scenario 

Contoso is a global organization with a complex IT infrastructure that includes a combination of on-premises data centers and cloud-based resources. They are looking to enhance their security posture by deploying Azure Sentinel, Microsoft's cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM). As part of this initiative, Contoso aims to onboard its cloud resources and servers to Azure Sentinel to gain better visibility and proactive threat detection and response capabilities.

## Overview

A Log Analytics workspace is a unique environment for logging data from Azure Monitor and other Azure services, such as Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Each workspace has its data repository and configuration but might combine data from multiple services. You can find more references about the Log Analytics Workspace here: `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview`

Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native solution that provides:

  - Security information and event management (SIEM)
  - Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)

Microsoft Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise. With Microsoft Sentinel, you get a single solution for attack detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response. You can find more references about the Log Analytics Workspace here: `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/overview`

In this exercise, you will create a Log Analytics Workspace and will integrate it will Microsoft Sentinel.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

* [Task 1: Enable Azure Sentinel](#task-1-enable-azure-sentinel)
* [Task 2: Onboard Azure resources and server to Azure Sentinel using Data connectors](#task-2-onboard-azure-resources-and-server-to-azure-sentinel-using-data-connectors)

      ![search sentinel](../media/search_sentinel.png)

2. Within the Microsoft Sentinel home page, click on **+ Create** to create and configure the Sentinel Workspace.

      ![create sentinel](../media/create_sentinel.png)

3. On the **Add Microsoft Sentinel to a workspace** page, select the existing workspace i.e, **log-contoso-diagnosticworkspace (1)** which was created in the previous task, then select **Add (2)**. This could take a few minutes.

      ![add workspace](../media/addlaw.png)

4. Navigate around the newly created Microsoft Sentinel workspace to become familiar with the user interface options.

## Task 2: Onboard Azure resources and server to Azure Sentinel using data connectors

This task includes the establishment of a connection between Windows and M365 data to the Sentinel workspace.

### Task 2.1: Connect an Azure Windows Virtual Machine to Microsoft Sentinel

 1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type **Sentinel (1)**, then select **Microsoft Sentinel (2)**.

      ![search sentinel](../media/selectsentinel.png)

 2. Select the Microsoft Sentinel Workspace you created earlier.
 
 3. Within the Microsoft Sentinel page, in the left navigation pane, click on **Content hub (1)** under the **Content management** section. Search **(2)** for and select **(3)** **Windows Security Events**. Click on the **Install (4)** button in the right navigation pane that shows up thus, resulting in the installation of the Windows Security Events Solution.

      ![Install Windows Security Events](../media/windows_security_events.png)

      >**Note**: The installation may take up to a minute. Wait for the **Install Success** notification, after which you can now notice the **Installed** count has increased to **1**.
